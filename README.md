# Bear Watcher!
Each year between July and September brown bears in the Katmai National Park congregate along the Brooks River.  This river is one of the main rivers that Sockeye Salmon swim up to spawn.  The brown bears wait in the shallows of the river and catch the salmon as they jump over rocks.  

As Katmain National Park new park ranger can use to track these bears!

## About the User
As a user, when the page loads, I should see a form that allows me to enter a bear name and image URL for a new bear and select one of the five species of bear found in Katmai National Park: Black Bears, Brown Bears, Grizzly Bears, and Polar Bears. As a user, when I click the submit button on the new bear form, a bear should be added to the page. When bears are being tracked (i.e., after I have added one), I should see all their information displayed on a card.

## Features
* When the page loads, a form and bear image and a fun flowing backgound.
